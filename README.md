# FibonacciInPairs
Takes two numbers and calculates how many steps is required to reach them by adding two pairs together in a sort of Fibonacci sequence

For Example:
- With the numbers 4,7
- You start with 1,1
- Add the left side to right twice and you get 1,3
- Add the right side to left once and you get 4,3
- Add the left side to right once and you get 4,7
- This took a total of 4 additions to reach the required number

There are combinations which are impossible to reach such as 21,7.  For these impossible combinations the program returns "impossible"
